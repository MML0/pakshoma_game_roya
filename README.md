# 🎮 AI-Generated Interactive Game  

## 📖 Overview  
This project is an **interactive game** where all visual content — over **1300 unique images** — has been generated with **AI models**.  
- **Image generation** was done using **Flux** and **Stable Diffusion/ComfyUI workflows**.  
- **Prompts** were written, expanded, and optimized using **GPT-based systems**.  
- The result is a **cohesive, story-driven visual experience**, where each scene is AI-generated but carefully curated to feel handcrafted.  

The game explores the boundaries of **AI creativity, interactive storytelling, and procedural content creation**.

## 🖼️ Content Creation Pipeline  
1. **Prompt Engineering**  
   - GPT was used to generate detailed scene descriptions.  
   - System prompts enforced cultural, environmental, and stylistic consistency.  

2. **Image Generation**  
   - Flux + Stable Diffusion (via ComfyUI) were used to render final images.  
   - Over **1300 images** were generated to cover game scenes, environments, and variations.  

3. **Curation & Integration**  
   - Images were reviewed and filtered for coherence.  
   - Final assets were integrated into the game engine.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Concept  
- The player experiences a **branching narrative**, where visual storytelling plays a key role.  
- Each choice reveals a new AI-generated image, immersing the player in a dynamically created world.  
- Themes include **exploration, creativity, and cultural richness**.

## 🔧 Technology Stack  
- **AI Models**: Flux, Stable Diffusion XL, custom LoRAs.  
- **Prompting Engine**: GPT (system + user-driven).  
- **Image Workflow**: ComfyUI pipelines with tuned parameters (steps, CFG, denoise).  
- **Game Framework**: *(insert your engine here: Unity / Godot / custom web engine)*.
